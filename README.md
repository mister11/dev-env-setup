# Fix

* arcolinuxd installs `yay-bin` by default - remove that before pacman install
* move .zshrc to .zshrc-old and .config/i3 to .config/i3-old if they exist (created if "Yes" option selected on first boot of Arco installation)

* zsh not default (probably fixed by removing 'become')
* ~/.asdf/plugins/java/set-java-home.zsh does not exist
* rofi resolution (might just be VM problem)

# Missing:

- socli completisons
- flyctl compeltions

- i3wm config file needs to be gitignored because it's autogenerated for work/personal
- dotfiles-private
    - keep private stuff there (scripts, aliases, work helpers)
    - have consolidation script in this repo (or just in a shell task) that will merge it with base dotfiles (simple cp will work)
    - merge will yield a new dotfiles folder locally on the file system then can then be stowed
    - that way, we can have clean dotfiles repos, but a single source of truth that is autogenerated
    - all updates to that autogenerated/consolidated folder should go through script/Ansbile shell script

- enable tlp service
